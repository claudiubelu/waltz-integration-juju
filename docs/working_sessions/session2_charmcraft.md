# Charmcraft Basics

[Juju and Charmed Operators Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GeLd9MrdBsHlCyJGHPIQbFIJh3OTCL0lPuMyx-KCsPQ/edit)

In this sessions we went throught the basics og creating a Waltz Charmed Operator. After building the charm we manually integrated it with a PostgreSQL database and checked if the service was running.

The charm code can be found in this repository. The following instructions were written to work on a Linux machine. 

The commands run in this sessions can be found [here](#commands).

Development setup:

### Install Charmcraft 
https://juju.is/docs/sdk/install-charmcraft
https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charmcraft-config

The recommended way to install charmcraft is from the stable channel with `sudo snap install charmcraft --classic`.

### Initialise your Charm
https://juju.is/docs/sdk/initialise-your-charm

To create your charm’s file tree structure, simply execute:

``` bash
$ mkdir my-new-charm; cd my-new-charm
$ charmcraft init
Charm operator package file and directory tree initialized.
TODO:

      README.md: Describe your charm in a few paragraphs of Markdown
      README.md: Provide high-level usage, such as required config or relations
   actions.yaml: change this example to suit your needs.
    config.yaml: change this example to suit your needs.
  metadata.yaml: fill out the charm's description
  metadata.yaml: fill out the charm's summary
  metadata.yaml: replace with containers for your workload (delete for non-k8s)
  metadata.yaml: each container defined above must specify an oci-image resource
   src/charm.py: change this example to suit your needs.
   src/charm.py: change this example to suit your needs.
   src/charm.py: change this example to suit your needs.
```

This creates all the essential files for your charm, including the actual src/charm.py skeleton and various items of metadata.

Additionally, Charmcraft assumes you want to work in Python following the Ops framework, so it will add requirements.txt and other conventional development files to support that.

#### README
A Markdown file that is displayed on the homepage for the charm on Charmhub. Generally, this README should detail the charm’s behaviour, how to deploy the charm, and provide links to resources for the supported application. This is a critical part of the Charm’s documentation, and is often the first experience potential users will have with the charm.


#### LICENSE
Charmcraft pre-populates the LICENSE file with the [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license. Before publication, it is important that you consider the implications of this and select a license appropriate for your use case. If you’re not sure which license to select, [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) can help you. For most charms, we recommend [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0), as this will allow for simple modification, redistribution, and packaging by the Charmhub community.

#### metadata.yaml
Contains descriptive information about the charm, its requirements, and its interfaces. There are two types of information: identifying and configuration.

Identifying information is used to describe the charm, its author, and its purpose; it is indexed by Charmhub to enable easy discovery of charms.

Configuration information is provided by the charm author to inform the Juju OLM how and where to deploy the charm depending on the intended platform, storage requirements, resources, and possible relationships. The full specification for `metadata.yaml` can be found in the [metadata reference](https://discourse.Charmhub.io/t/5213).

#### requirements.txt
A standard Python [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format) used to declare and pin the version of any Python libraries required by a charm in production. This will be pre-populated with `ops` - the Charmed Operator Framework. Any dependencies specified here will be bundled with the charm when it is built with `charmcraft pack`.

#### config.yaml
Contains the definitions for all possible configuration values supported by the charm. Each configuration item is defined with a type, default value, and description. For further details on configuration, see [Handling configuration](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/config).

#### actions.yaml
Contains the definitions for all the manual actions supported by the charm. In addition to the name of the supported commands, `actions.yaml` also contains descriptions and a list of parameters for each action. For further details on actions, see [Defining actions](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/actions).


#### requirements-dev.txt
As with `requirements.txt`, this is a standard Python [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirements-file-format), but specifies only those dependencies that are used during development. Examples of this might include testing libraries, linters, etc. These dependencies will not be bundled with the charm when it is built.

#### run_tests
A Bash script used as a helper for running unit tests. By default, it is set up to lint with [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and start unit tests with [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). You may choose to manage this activity differently as your charm grows or testing requirements increase. Some charm authors use [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for this purpose.

#### src/charm.py
The default entry point for a charm. This file must be executable, and should include a [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) to indicate the desired interpreter. For many charms, this file will contain the majority of the charm code. It is possible to change the name of this file, but additional changes are then required to enable the charm to be built with `charmcraft`.

#### tests/test_charm.py 
This is the companion to `src/charm.py` for unit testing. It is pre-populated with standard constructs used by `unittest` and Harness. More detail is covered in [Unit testing](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/testing).

#### Other files
Alongside the files listed above,  during charm development you might also come across the following:

#### charmcraft.yaml
This file is specified in the root of your charm directory and is used to help instruct `charmcraft` what is in the directory, and therefore how the directory should be built. Currently, this file is  mandatory only if you’re packing a [Bundle](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/bundles). 

More information can be found in the [charmcraft Configuration](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charmcraft-config) document.

#### manifest.yaml
The manifest.yaml file is generated automatically by the `charmcraft` tool when a charm or bundle is packed. It is used by Charmhub and `charmcraft` to identify the version, build time, OS name, and version at build time, as well as the architectures that the charm can run on. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/canonical/charmcraft/issues/273). This manifest contains a simplified version of the `charmcraft.yaml` file that is used to verify whether a machine charm is compatible with the running system.

More information can be found in the [Charmcraft Configuration](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charmcraft-config) document.

#### version
When your charm is published to Charmhub, an attempt is made to automatically determine the version if there is metadata for a version control system in the path. In order, Charmhub checks for `git`, `hg` (Mercurial), and `bzr` (Bazaar). If a metadata path is found, one of the following commands is used to check for version information:

``` bash
git describe --dirty --always
hg id -n
bzr version-info
```

If there is no version control metadata, Charmhub will look for a `version` file, which can be used to manually specify the version which should be displayed.

Finally, if all of these fail, the version will match the `revision` of your charm.

#### icon.svg
An 100px x 100px SVG icon used for display on Charmhub. For more information please see this [post](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/creating-icons-for-charms/1041).
