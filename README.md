# A Charmed Operator for Waltz

This is the repository for the Waltz charmed operator, also known as "charm". This can be deployed individually or as a [bundle](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle). 

> ðŸ’¡If you are evaluating Waltz, you should use the whole [bundle](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle) instead of this single charm. You should only deploy this charmed operator by itself if you already have a PostgreSQL database.

> ðŸ’¡ You can find more information about Charmed Operators and Charmed Waltz in the [bundle](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle) repository.

## Deploying this Charmed Operator

If you donâ€™t have a Juju model, you can follow [this guide](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle/blob/main/docs/guides/LocalDeployment.md) until the point you have one. You can then deploy this single charmed operator (instead of the whole bundle) running

```
juju deploy finos-waltz-k8s
``` 

### Connecting to PostgreSQL

To connect to your already existing PostgreSQL database, you can run
```
juju config finos-waltz-k8s db-host="<db-host>" db-port="<db-port>" db-name="<db-name>" db-username="<db-username>" db-password="<db-password>"
```
## OCI Images

This charm requires the Waltz docker image: ``ghcr.io/finos/waltz``.

## FINOS Waltz Charm and Bundle release automation process

This repository is configured to automatically build and publish a new Charm revision after a Pull Request merges. The new charm revisions will be released on the ``latest/edge`` channel with the latest associated Waltz image revision. For more information, see [here](docs/CharmPublishing.md).

The [waltz-juju-bundle](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle) repository has a GitHub action configured to check periodically if there is a new [official Waltz release](https://github.com/finos/waltz/pkgs/container/waltz). If there is a new release, the GitHub action will do the following steps:

- upload the new Waltz image versions file into Charmhub.
- create a new release for the FINOS Waltz charm on the ``latest/edge`` and ``release-version/edge`` channels.
- create a new ``release-release-version`` branch in the [waltz-juju-bundle](https://github.com/finos/waltz-juju-bundle) repository.
- update the ``bundle.yaml`` file, having the Waltz charm use the ``release-version/edge`` channel and create a commit.
- upload the new ``bundle.yaml`` file into Charmhub on the ``release-version/edge`` track.

Each repository has included in its ``README.md`` file and docs information about how their GitHub actions have been configured and what repositories secrets they require. In summary, they all require a Charmhub authentication token that has the permission to upload resources for the respective charms.
